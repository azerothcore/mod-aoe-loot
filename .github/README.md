# Important note

- The mod allows you to obtain all the items from nearby bodies, by looting only one of them.
- It is important to make a modification in the emulator, regarding the delay of the bodies.

```
#
#    Rate.Corpse.Decay.Looted
#        Description: Multiplier for Corpse.Decay.* to configure how long creature corpses stay
#                     after they have been looted.
#         Default:    0.5

Rate.Corpse.Decay.Looted = 0.5
```

Consider changing that value, to `0.01` or lower. Perform tests to avoid problems.
