## Important notes

The module is currently under development, but is functional. It should be compatible at least with the module: mod-solo-lfg. Loot can be done in an area, both in a group and alone, and it works both when obtaining an item and when obtaining gold, so the client's self-loot option could be enabled. In the configuration file, there are some variables that can be modified, such as sending the item by mail if the bags are full, or increasing the search range for bodies. When you chop an ore, you may also obtain all the items from the bodies, with chests I have done the test and it does not work, but with ores, I understand that it does, it remains to be seen if it also supports the herbalist profession in case you have some material near the bodies.
